comment: The Plant Experimental Condition Ontology describes the treatments, growing conditions, and/or study types used in various types of plant biology experiments. The subjects of the studies may also include in vitro plant structures (PO:0000004). The broadest classes are the plant study types (PECO:0007231), where the terms describe the type of growth facility used in an experiment.  Each study type such as field study (PECO:0007256), growth chamber study (PECO:0007269), greenhouse study (PECO:0007248), or laboratory study (PECO:0007255) will also involve different growing conditions, and may also include specific biotic (PECO:0007357) and/or abiotic (PECO:0007191) plant treatments.  A plant treatment (PECO:0001001) may be a component of a plant experimental condition (PECO:0007359), and the plant study type (PECO:0007231).

comment: This type of herbicides are taken up by plant root and leaf tissue and transported to the meristems via both phloem and xylem. The herbicide stops the activity of the enzyme, acetolactate synthase (ALS), which is involved in branch chain amino acid (valine, leucine and isoleucine) synthesis.
